## Commentary

"Poor in spirit" refers to a recognition of one's spiritual poverty before God. It is the opposite of spiritual pride or self-sufficiency.

This is the gateway to all the other beatitudes - we must first recognize our need before we can receive from God.

## Application

Ask yourself: Am I approaching God with humility, recognizing my complete dependence on Him?
