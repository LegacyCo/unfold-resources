## Commentary
"...as they were able to hear it." The Greek word that we translate "able" is edynanto - the inherent capacity in someone to carry something out, the strength, ability, or power to do something. 

The Greek word for "hear" is akouein. This word doesn't just mean to hear something audibly. It also embraces the idea of apprehending the thing heard with the mind and responding in conformity to it. For example; I don't just "hear" the fire alarm. I hear the fire alarm and respond by running out of the building.

The point is this: Jesus speaks the word in proportion to the hearers capacity to hear AND respond to what He is speaking. As He says in v25, "Whoever has/does not have..." Has what? Edynanto - the capacity to honor His words by responding to them in obedience. To them He will share even more of His words. Or as Jesus says in v24, "With the same measure that you use, it will be measured to you; and to you who hear, more will be given."
