## Commentary
It was when the disciples were alone with Jesus that He explained all things to them. This word alone carries with it the idea of "being in possession of" (see John 1:11 - "He. came to His own..."). The disciples were the possession of the Lord, which gave them the right to be alone with Jesus. They belonged to Him in a way that those outside did not (see v11).

## Word Study (optional section within the note)


## Application
If you're a follower of Jesus, you belong to Him in the same way the disciples did here in Mark 4. You have the right and the privilege to be alone with Him. We shouldn't take this precious privilege for granted. Make time to be alone with Jesus.
